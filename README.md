# üõ°Ô∏è Realistic Attacker Emulation with Layered Detection Logic

This project reconstructs attacker command chains from fragmented Linux audit logs using Splunk macros, regex extraction, and forensic-grade aggregation. It supports modular dashboards, session-aware correlation, and realistic emulation of adversary behavior.

---

## üîß Components

- **Auditd Rules**: Custom rules for capturing `EXECVE` and `SYSCALL` events
- **Splunk Macro**: `reconstruct_command_chain` parses and joins fragmented audit events
- **Dashboard Panel**: Visualizes attacker command chains with metadata
- **Sample Logs** *(optional)*: Anonymized auditd logs for testing and validation

### üìä Dashboard Panel in Action

This panel visualizes attacker command chains reconstructed from audit logs. It displays metadata like `exe`, `comm`, `pid`, `auid`, `ses`, and full command chains.
